📌 Project Overview

This prototype is part of the Real World Project: Designing a Secure, In-House Chatbot System.
The goal is to demonstrate a minimal, secure, locally hosted chatbot interaction — proving technical feasibility for a fully private, in-house AI assistant.

This demo focuses on:

Local-only architecture

Secure token-based authentication

Simple frontend and backend integration

Zero external API calls

🔐 Key Security Feature Demonstrated
Secure Token Authentication

Every request made to the chatbot must include a valid token in the Authorization header.

✔ Prevents unauthorized access

✔ Demonstrates access control

✔ Illustrates how internal systems verify identity

✔ Ensures only approved employees can use the chatbot

If the token is invalid, the backend rejects the request with a 401 Unauthorized error.
